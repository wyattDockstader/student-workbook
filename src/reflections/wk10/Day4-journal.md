Read Foundations of C# > C# Enum's and answer the following questions
<b>What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?</b>
  Emums are strongly typed constants, Give you the ability to give strongly typed integral values symbolic names to make them more maintainable.
<b>How can you modify an Enum?</b>
You can modify the underlying base type, you can also change the value of an emum number. 
<b>How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)</b>
I have not used a enum yet but i can see a obveous use would be specifying days of the week(1-7) or months in the year (1-12).
