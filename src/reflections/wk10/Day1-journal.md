<b>What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?</b>
Value Type- Holds data value in its own memory space.
Reference Type- Stores the address where the value is being stored.
Pointer Type- unmanaged referent type, do not inherent from object, used by reference type to identify storage location.

<b>What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?</b>
bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong, and ushort.  It corrisponds to primitive data types but has alot more types and doesnt include strings.

<b>In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?</b>
Reference types values are stored in memory and the data holds the location, where value data directly holds the value.
