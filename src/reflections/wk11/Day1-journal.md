<b>What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?</b>
Inheritance is a mechanism that describes a relationship between classes and allows sharing of data between those classes.

<b>How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?</b>
The derived class cant inherit finalizers and constructors, it does have access to all other attributes.

<b>How does accessibility affect inheritance?</b>
Protected and public members are accessable by derived classes where private members would not be.
