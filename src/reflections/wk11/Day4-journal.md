<b>Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.</b>


Its hard to summarized my experience with Codeworks.  In a word ... Outstanding, When I started the course I could barely use the command line and had serious doubts about my possibility of success. Today I have several full stack aplication I'm building for friends and family and I feel a real passion for Development.  It is clear to me that the refined curriculum and tools avalible to me are the reason I am a full stack developer today.  If I had a concern it would be fear of leaving the course, Ive found camaraderie and happiness I didn't expect to find and Im fond of my peers and the Staff at Codeworks.  As the final looms near and I hear the warnings of time management I plan to utilize scrum/ agile methods to plan my project and time blocks out to ensure i stay on task and schedule.  I've enjoyed the constant challenge and fast pace of the course, the early week "fail fast" mentality that surely transitions into a "you got this" confidence has been effective and equally rewarding.
