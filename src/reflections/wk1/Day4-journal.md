<b>What is the purpose of wire-framing?</b>

Wire framing is a design method that allows you to quickly create and demo a website design.  This not only helps with the overall design process and gives full scope of a project but allows users and stakeholders to supply input to the designer early in development saving time, money and utimately delivering a better product to the end user.

<b>What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?</b>

There are three levels of wire framing; low, mid and high fidelity.  Low fidelity is a simple often hand written layout used in early development and uses little detail to get the idea and layout developed.  Mid fidelity is a cleaner layout that will often be designed digitally. With little to no use of color mid fidelity will supply greater detail, hint toward functionality and more specific design aspects.  High fidelity will be a higher detailed rendering of a website that will feature colors, pictures and writing relitive to the end product. 

<b>Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?</b>

Most definately wire frames are crucial in the development industry.  The low effort required to make design and functionality changes not only saves time but money compared to late development changes that could possibly require multi level adaptations to functionality and style.
