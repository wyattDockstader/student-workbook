 <b>What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?</b>

A Pseudo-Class is a css selector that targets elements in a specific state. I can particularlly see ":hover" being useful for a more interactive styling for users. 

<b>What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?</b>

Specificty is a system built into css that decides which of multiple rules targeting the same element gets applied.  You can use specificity to over rule load order and style a element differently than it would otherwise be.

<b>What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?</b>

The !important feature over rules all specificity, the problem would arise if you needed to style the element in your code, specificity would never override the !important feature.
