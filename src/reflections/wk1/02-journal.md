Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > CSS and answer the following questions

What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

A Pseudo-Class is a css selector that targets elements in a specific state. I can particularlly see ":hover" being useful for a more interactive styling for users. 

What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificty is a system built into css that decides which of multiple rules targeting the same element gets applied.  You can use specificity to over rule load order and style a element differently than it would otherwise be.

What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

The !important feature over rules all specificity, the problem would arise if you needed to style the element in your code, specificity would never override the !important feature.
