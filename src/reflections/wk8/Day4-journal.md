What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
unit testing- testing small individual pieces of code 
component testing- testing a collection of units that has been mounted to the dom
E2E testing- complete user interation testing beginning to end  

What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
unit testing seems to be the best balance between sacrificing time vs usability, but its very much dependant on your code quality.

What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
personally the component tests seem unreasonable because if there is a problem youll spend more time finding the issue than it would have taken to test units.
