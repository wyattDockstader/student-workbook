<b>What is Scope ?</b>
The scope of a variable refers to where its available for use a variable declared outside a function with var would be globally scoped and could be accessed from anywhere in the code while a variable declared inside a function would be function scoped and only referencable from inside the function.

<b>What is Hoisting ?</b>
Hoisting is a javascript mechanism that moves variables and declerations to the top of their scope without their value attached, so a variable can be hoisted to the top of their scope and return value undifined.

<b>In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?</b>
You would use Var to globally scope a variable and or needed to redifine the variable, you would use let to block scope a variable, const is blocked scoped and cannot be redefined.
