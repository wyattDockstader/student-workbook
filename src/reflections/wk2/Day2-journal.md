<b>What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts</b>
 first is a function decleration by using the function keyword followed by the function name, this type of function will be hoisted and will be available to invoke at anytime.  Second is a function expression or a nameless function, these functions will not be hoisted and cannot be invoked before they are defined. Lastly is the function arrow expression which is short hand for a function expression and do not create their own this value.

<b>What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?</b>
perameters are the place holders when a functioned is defined and the arguments are supplied when the function is invoked and then take the place of the perameters.

<b>What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?</b>
A higher order function is a function that accepts another function as a parameter. A good example is array.prototype.map.
