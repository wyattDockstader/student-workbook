<b>What problem does using exports solve?</b>
Using exports makes your encapsilated code modules accessible to importing modules.

<b>How does export differ from export default?</b>
Export default doesnt require the use of named declerations and export default can only be used once in a module.

<b>What is a benefit of using the Module System?</b>
Privacy, modules  are private by default and code is shared by using export ind import.
